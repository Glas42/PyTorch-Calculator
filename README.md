# PyTorch-Calculator


### About

What is this app?
PyTorch-Calculator is a python application that uses a custom PyTorch ML model to interpret and solve mathematical expressions you've drawn to the UI.
The machine learning model and the dataset used for training are available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Glas42/PyTorch-Calculator). The app will automatically download and update the model as needed.
The app has only been tested on Windows and is also probably not compatible with other platforms.


### How to Install the app

1. Download Python 3.11.x from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) and install it
2. Clone or [download](https://github.com/Glas42/PyTorch-Calculator/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) this repository
3. Run the ```Start.bat``` script, it will automatically create a virtual environment and install the required packages
