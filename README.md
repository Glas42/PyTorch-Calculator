# PyTorch-Calculator
PyTorch-Calculator is a python application that uses PyTorch to interpret and solve mathematical expressions and equations you've written to the infinite big Canvas (limited by the size and decimal points of numbers).

This AI part of the app doesn't work yet, still in development!
